# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Following repo consists of detectng breast cancer using K Nearest Neighbors classifier

### K Nearest Neighbors classifier (KNN)
1. First we take K which use to calculate KNN.
2. We canculate Distance between test featureset and all the train featureset
3. We take K nearest neighbours
4. New feature set is assign to a group of which majority of K nearest featureset belongs to.

### About the data
### Breast Tumor Data
Data is taken from University of California, Irvine (UCI) collection
Data Link - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/ 

We are trying identyfy wheather cancer is malignant and benign base on the data given
In short, the meaning of malignant is cancerous and the meaning of benign is non-cancerous. 

### Data interpretation
Malignant data makes one cluster whereas, benign makes one cluster, So KNN is able to find nearest data so accurately.

With Help of KNN we have achieve nearly acuracy of 96%.
